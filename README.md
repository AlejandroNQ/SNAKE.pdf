   ↓ 
 
  -Hover your mouse over the arrows on the left to stir the snake
  -Click on the middle button to pause/resume game (you may have to click outside and then back inside to resume)
  -Hover your mouse over the speed control arrows to make the snake move faster or slower. (does not work while paused)


### Snake
The game itself is coded in JavaScript using [Adobe's JS API](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf) or rather, [the small subset of it implemented by chromiumn browsers](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2524/fpdfsdk/src/javascript). 

This presents quite a few challenges as explained in [this brilliant post](https://github.com/osnr/horrifying-pdf-experiments/blob/master/README.md) by [Omar Rizwan](https://github.com/osnr) which has been the main source for this project.
